# Crawling-Surpent
A game developed using [Pygame](www.pygame.org) framework for self-learning purpuse.

It is a concept of a very popular and classic video game [**Snake**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) which I named as *[Crawling-Surpent](# "I know its little weird but I could not think of any other name")*. Snake is a video game where the player controls a snake i.e a dot/square on a plane, which grows when it's head touches another object named as food and it dies if it's head touches the border or itself.
